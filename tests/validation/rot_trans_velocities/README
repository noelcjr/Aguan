Angular Velocity Validation
July 3rd, 2016

Purpose:
    To check that angular velocities do not alter translational velocities and trajectories
and viceversa.  

Test:
    In this test, an 8 water molecule simulation is set up by manually
modifying the a randomly generated RST file. In the RST file, each molecule has 
different initial X, Y and Z rotational angular velocities. Angular velocities 
of 1 radian per femtosecond is given to each possible XYZ axis combination in 
the following way:.  

ANGVELS n= 8 x 3 X(0),Y(0),Z(0)...X(n-1),Y(n-1),Z(n-1)
0 0.0 0.0 0.0
1 0.0 0.0 279.2526803190927
2 0.0 279.2526803190927 0.0
3 0.0 279.2526803190927 279.2526803190927
4 279.2526803190927 0.0 0.0
5 279.2526803190927 0.0 279.2526803190927
6 279.2526803190927 279.2526803190927 0.0
7 279.2526803190927 279.2526803190927 279.2526803190927

Angular velocity = (2*np.pi/36)/0.000625 = 279.2526803190927 radians per reduced unit of
time, whic is equivalent to a femto-second. This is equivalent to 10 degrees per step.

Translationa velocities are given the following values:
 n= 8 x 3 X(0),Y(0),Z(0)...X(n-1),Y(n-1),Z(n-1)
0 0.0 0.0 100.0
1 0.0 0.0 100.0
2 0.0 0.0 100.0
3 0.0 0.0 100.0
4 0.0 0.0 100.0
5 0.0 0.0 100.0
6 0.0 0.0 100.0
7 0.0 0.0 100.0

Angular velocities are in reduced units in the restart file. They are not converted
because the measure of their magnitud is translated into a temperature which gives more
meaning.

After one step, Molecule 0 in the simulation moved from 0.993nm to 1.023nm in one step. This
is expexted from the integrator in which:
          r(t+1) = r(t) + dt * v(t)
dt * v(t) = 0.000625 * 100 = 0.0625 ro = 0.020 nm

From the trajectory, it can be seen that molecule 0 moves in the z-axis direction from 
0.993nm to 1.013nm. 

This test is simple and the result seems obvious to expect. However, when a future test is
perform with an applied electric field, we will see how rotetional and translational degrees
of freedom change.

It can be seen that from the vizualization of the trajectories perform a full rotation for the water    #
molecules at the expected number of steps and that translation and rotation degrees of freedom do not
change interfere with each other trajectories in the rotational and tranlation motions. 
This validates this part of the program.              #

NOTE:If the molecules are visualized using VMD, make sure to load the CRD after the PSF file, and follow
that with the DCD file. When loading the CRD, make sure that the file type that tells VMD the forlmat of
the file is the one corresponding to "CHARMM coordinates". This is because the suffix CRD is used
by another program with a different format.
