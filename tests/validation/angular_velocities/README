Angular Velocity Validation
July 3rd, 2016

Test:
    In this test, an 8 water molecule simulation is set up by manually
modifying the a randomly generated RST file. In the RST file, each molecule has 
different initial X, Y and Z rotational angular velocities. Angular velocities 
of 1 radian per femtosecond is given to each possible XYZ axis combination in 
the following way:.  

ANGVELS n= 8 x 3 X(0),Y(0),Z(0)...X(n-1),Y(n-1),Z(n-1)
0 0.0 0.0 0.0
1 0.0 0.0 279.2526803190927
2 0.0 279.2526803190927 0.0
3 0.0 279.2526803190927 279.2526803190927
4 279.2526803190927 0.0 0.0
5 279.2526803190927 0.0 279.2526803190927
6 279.2526803190927 279.2526803190927 0.0
7 279.2526803190927 279.2526803190927 279.2526803190927

Angular velocity = (2*np.pi/36)/0.000625 = 279.2526803190927 radians per reduced unit of
time, whic is equivalent to a femto-second. This is equivalent to 10 degrees per step.

Setup:
    An RST file is randomly generated, and manually modify to setup the test in the following
way. The water molecules are all oriented the same way at the beginning of the simulation. 
The rCut is set to ro=0.03 so that molecules do not interact with each other and accelarate 
other molecules. All initial accelerations are set to zero, and all transaltional degrees of 
freedom are set to 0.0. All waters start in the same orientation.

Results:
    The simulation was ran for 36 steps. Water molecules are aligned n a 2.0x2.0x2.0 box
with the following coordinates. 
0 0.3 1.0 1.0
1 0.5 1.0 1.0
2 0.7 1.0 1.0
3 0.9 1.0 1.0
4 1.1 1.0 1.0
5 1.3 1.0 1.0
6 1.5 1.0 1.0
7 1.7 1.0 1.0
The first water is located near the edge of the x-coordinat enad does not move because
it has 0.0 angular velocity in the XYZ directions. left of that waters move in the following way:

Water 0 does not move at all
Water 1 moves around the Z   axis and completes a full rotation in 36 steps or femto-seconds.
Water 2 moves around the Y   axis and completes a full rotation in 36 femto-seconds.
Water 3 moves around the YZ  axis and completes a full rotation in 25-26 femto-seconds.
Water 4 moves around the X   axis and completes a full rotation in 36 femto-seconds.
Water 5 moves around the XZ  axis and completes a full rotation in 25-26 femto-seconds.
Water 6 moves around the XY  axis and completes a full rotation in 25-26 femto-seconds.
Water 1 moves around the XYZ axis and completes a full rotation in 20-21 femto-seconds.

This proves that the program is right. Water molecules with non zero angular velocities 
around one axis only, complete a full rotation in 36 steps. 

angular velocity = 2*PI/36 = 0.17453292519943295
Number of steps to complete a full rotation: 2*PI/0.17453292519943295 = 36.0 steps

When the same angular velocity is applied to 2 or 3 axis at the same time, the rotations are completed
in fewer steps. That is becase for 2 axis the combined angular velocity for two vectors is:

sqrt(avx*avx + avy*avy) = 0.24682682989768701
Number of steps to complete a full rotation: 2*PI/0.24682682989768701 = 25.45584412271571 steps

and the combine velocity of three vectors is:

sqrt(avx*avx + avy*avy + avz*avz)) = 0.30229989403903629
Number of steps to complete a full rotation: 2*PI/0.30229989403903629 = 20.784609690826528 steps

It can be seen from a vizualization of the trajectories perform a full rotation for the water    #
molecules at the expected number of steps. This validates this part of the program.              #

NOTE:If the molecules are visualized using VMD, make sure to load the CRD after the PSF file, and follow
that with the DCD file. When loading the CRD, make sure that the file type that tells VMD the format of
the file is the one corresponding to "CHARMM coordinates". This is because the suffix CRD is used
by another program with a different format.
